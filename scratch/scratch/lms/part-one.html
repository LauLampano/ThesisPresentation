                    This module will help you learn how people back then could identify the shape and even the estimated
                    circumference of the earth without advanced technology. Also, it will deepen your understanding of how
                    astronomers contributed so much to the emergence of correct information about the solar system and the
                    entire cosmos. Aside from the mentioned, you will get yourself informed about how Galileo corrected all
                    of Aristotle’s assumptions about motion that led to the discovery of free-fall, vertical upward motion,
                    and projectile motion. Finally, you will get to recall and master information about the laws of motion
                    and the law of universal gravitation and their applications to other principles that include momentum,
                    impulse-momentum theorem, and friction.

                <p>After going through this module, you should be able to:
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Explain how the Greeks knew that the earth is spherical.</li>
                    <li>Cite examples of astronomical phenomena known to astronomers before the advent of the telescope.
                    </li>
                    <li> Explain how Brahe’s innovations and extensive data collection in observational astronomy paved the
                        way for Kepler’s discovery of his laws of planetary motion.</li>
                    <li> Comparing and contrasting the Aristotelian and Galilean Conceptions of vertical motion, horizontal
                        motion, and projectile motion.</li>
                    <li>Explain how Galileo inferred that objects in a vacuum fall with uniform acceleration and that force
                        are not necessary to sustain horizontal motion.</li>
                    <li>Perform calculations about free-falling bodies.</li>
                    <li>Explaining the subtle distinction between Newton’s 1st Law of Motion (or Law of Inertia) and
                        Galileo’s assertion that force is not necessary to sustain horizontal motion. </li>
                    <li>Use algebra to calculate problems involving Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion and Newton’s Law of Universal
                        Gravitation.</li>
                    <li>Use the law of conservation of momentum to solve one-dimensional collision problems.</li>

                    <p>Aristotle was glorified as one of the greatest philosophers of all time. His ideas, particularly
                        to motion, persisted for nearly 2,000 years, but not until the curiosity of Galileo. Once more,
                        help Galileo refute Aristotle through the projectile motion activity below.</p>

                        <h6>Goals:</h6>
                        <li>Create your procedure and experiment to refute Aristotle's claims and support Galileo's
                            findings.</li>
                        <li>Example: If you've ever thrown anything, you know it moves in a specific way. If you throw
                            it in an angle, it goes up, and then it comes down like this, and the path through the air
                            is what we mathematically call a parabola, and that's how things behave. They don't act
                            according to this idea of impetus that Aristotle thought. Let us test this concept in this
                            simulation activity.</li>
                        <li>You can determine if there is a change in the direction and position of the object to be
                            shot at a constant speed at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40-degree angles:

                                <li>if there is no air resistance</li>
                                <li>if there is air resistance</li>
