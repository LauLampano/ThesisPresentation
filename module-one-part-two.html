            <p>
                This module will help you learn how people back then could identify the shape and even the estimated
                circumference of the earth without advanced technology. Also, it will deepen your understanding of how
                astronomers contributed so much to the emergence of correct information about the solar system and the
                entire cosmos. Aside from the mentioned, you will get yourself informed about how Galileo corrected all
                of Aristotle’s assumptions about motion that led to the discovery of free-fall, vertical upward motion,
                and projectile motion. Finally, you will get to recall and master information about the laws of motion
                and the law of universal gravitation and their applications to other principles that include momentum,
                impulse-momentum theorem, and friction.

                <li>Cite examples of astronomical phenomena known to astronomers before the advent of the telescope.
                </li>
                <li> Explain how Brahe’s innovations and extensive data collection in observational astronomy paved the
                    way for Kepler’s discovery of his laws of planetary motion.</li>
                <li> Comparing and contrasting the Aristotelian and Galilean Conceptions of vertical motion, horizontal
                    motion, and projectile motion.</li>
                <li>Explain how Galileo inferred that objects in a vacuum fall with uniform acceleration and that force
                    are not necessary to sustain horizontal motion.</li>
                <li>Perform calculations about free-falling bodies.</li>
                <li>Explaining the subtle distinction between Newton’s 1st Law of Motion (or Law of Inertia) and
                    Galileo’s assertion that force is not necessary to sustain horizontal motion. </li>
                <li>Use algebra to calculate problems involving Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion and Newton’s Law of Universal
                    Gravitation.</li>

                    <p>The Law of Universal Gravitation states that the force of gravitation is directly proportional to
                        the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them. If the
                        law of universal gravitation has been proven to exist here on earth and in the entire universe,
                        then why do we not feel any attraction between the person next to us? </p>

                        <li>Create your procedure and experiment to refute Aristotle's claims and support Galileo's
                            findings.</li>
                        <li>Example: If you've ever thrown anything, you know it moves in a specific way. If you throw
                            it in an angle, it goes up, and then it comes down like this, and the path through the air
                            is what we mathematically call a parabola, and that's how things behave. They don't act
                            according to this idea of impetus that Aristotle thought. Let us test this concept in this
                            simulation activity.</li>
                        <li>You can determine if there is a change in the direction and position of the object to be
                            shot at a constant speed at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40-degree angles:
