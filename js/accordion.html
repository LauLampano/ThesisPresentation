            This module will help you learn how people back then could identify the shape and even the estimated
            circumference of the earth without advanced technology. Also, it will deepen your understanding of how
            astronomers contributed so much to the emergence of correct information about the solar system and the
            entire cosmos. Aside from the mentioned, you will get yourself informed about how Galileo corrected all
            of Aristotle’s assumptions about motion that led to the discovery of free-fall, vertical upward motion,
            and projectile motion. Finally, you will get to recall and master information about the laws of motion
            and the law of universal gravitation and their applications to other principles that include momentum,
            impulse-momentum theorem, and friction.

        After going through this module, you should be able to:
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Explain how the Greeks knew that the earth is spherical.</li>
            <li>Cite examples of astronomical phenomena known to astronomers before the advent of the telescope.
            </li>
            <li> Explain how Brahe’s innovations and extensive data collection in observational astronomy paved the
                way for Kepler’s discovery of his laws of planetary motion.</li>
            <li> Comparing and contrasting the Aristotelian and Galilean Conceptions of vertical motion, horizontal
                motion, and projectile motion.</li>
            <li>Explain how Galileo inferred that objects in a vacuum fall with uniform acceleration and that force
                are not necessary to sustain horizontal motion.</li>
            <li>Perform calculations about free-falling bodies.</li>
            <li>Explaining the subtle distinction between Newton’s 1st Law of Motion (or Law of Inertia) and
                Galileo’s assertion that force is not necessary to sustain horizontal motion. </li>
            <li>Use algebra to calculate problems involving Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion and Newton’s Law of Universal
                Gravitation.</li>
            <li>Use the law of conservation of momentum to solve one-dimensional collision problems.</li>

            This part of the module will help you understand further what lies ahead in the concepts about the
            history of astronomy, theories on motion, and Newton’s laws through the interactive activities set out
            for you.
